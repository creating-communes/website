## ??? So Many Questions 
Where should we buy land? How much should it cost? What's an acre? How many acres do we need? How many people will be there? What utilities do we need? Where does a septic tank go? Will we need a well as well? Can we be near water? Should we have a blog explaining our journey?

At least that last question has been answered -- welcome.
