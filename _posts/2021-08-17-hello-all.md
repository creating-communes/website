## ??? So Many Questions 
Where should we buy land? Should we grow food? What's an acre? How many acres do we need? How many people will be there? What utilities do we need? Where does a septic tank go? Will we need a well as well? Should we have a blog explaining our journey?

At least that last question has been answered -- welcome.
